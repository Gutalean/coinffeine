  /** Starting point of the service actor.
    *
    * This function defines the starting point of the service actor. Once a [[Service.Start]]
    * is received, the result of this function will be used to determine what to do: cancel the
    * start, start right away or going to an starting state.
    *
    * The simplest behavior consist on become started directly. You can do that as follows:
    *
    * {{{
    *   override def onStart(args: MyArgs) = {
    *     otherActor ! SomeMessage
    *     BecomeStarted(processingMessages)
    *   }
    * }}}
    *
    * In the case of going to the starting state, the actor will continue that way until
    * [[completeStart()]] is called. For example:
    *
    * {{{
    *   override def onStart(args: MyArgs) = {
    *     otherActor ! SomeMessage
    *     BecomeStarting {
    *       case SomeResponse => completeStart(beingInitialized)
    *       case OtherResponse(ex) => cancelStart(ex)
    *     }
    *   }
    * }}}
    *
    * Cancelling the start is even simpler:
    *
    * {{{
    *   override def onStart(args: MyArgs) = CancelStart(new Exception("not ready"))
    * }}}
    *
    * @param args  Starting arguments
    * @return      How to transition from start to starting or started
