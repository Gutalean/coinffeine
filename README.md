Coinffeine
==========

Coinffeine P2P FIAT-Bitcoin exchange implementation.


Getting Started
---------------

To build Coinffeine you will need:

 * Java Development Kit (JDK) 8u45 or higher (JDK 7 or higher is enough if you
   are not interested in `coinffeine-gui` module)
 * A working [SBT 0.13](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html)
 * Protobuf compiler 2.5.0 or higher. You can get it with your favourite
   package manager(`protobuf` in brew, `protobuf-compiler` in apt-get and
   macports) or directly from its
   [project page](https://github.com/google/protobuf/tags).

To compile all the modules and run their tests:

    sbt compile test

To run the peer from the sources:

    sbt gui/run

The application can be natively packaged by the following command. Note that
you should have installed the corresponding native tools such as RPM on Red Had
or the `fakeroot` package in Ubuntu/Debian.

    sbt gui/packageJavafx


Running several instances on one machine
----------------------------------------

The application locks the data directory (coinffeine at your default app
config folder, `~/.coinffeine` for Linux) to prevent corrupting the
transaction information so you cannot run two instances unless you use two
different data folders.  To do so use `--data-path <path>` as command line
arguments.


Getting coverage metrics
------------------------

To get coverage metrics just run `sbt clean coverage test coverageAggregate`
and look at `target/scala-2.x/scoverage-report/scoverage-report/index.html`.


Generating release binaries
---------------------------

To generate all module binaries that can be generated on the host platform 
(you wont generate Win-64 binaries from Mac) just run:

    sbt release

And you will find the binaries at `target/release/<version>`.


Continuous Integration
----------------------

When building on a CI environment (e.g., Jenkins), it is recommended to define the
property `-Dconfig.resource=application-ci.conf`. This will make Akka to use an
alternative config file that introduces a dilation in the timeouts used by the test probes.
This is especially useful to avoid false errors in heavily loaded Jenkins servers.
